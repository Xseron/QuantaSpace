Our challenge was to develop a groundbreaking tool that would revolutionize the way technical requirements are managed in the aerospace industry by streamlining the process of reviewing and updating requirements and ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of vital documents. 
Considering all of the challenges put in front of us, we added __ key features to QuantaSpace. The first and most important one is an integrated AI chatbot, that not only will answer any of the userâ€™s questions but will also generate actionable recommendations based on the analyzed data. It breaks down user-uploaded documents, understands context, identifies key phrases, and extracts relevant technical information. Secondly, our AI algorithm will be able to summarize and categorize contents into three topics which are: maintenance, safety, and design, to make research faster and easier. And lastly, it notifies users when updates relevant to their interests become available.  
It solves the challenge by enabling professionals to access and apply relevant information efficiently, improving accuracy, and compliance while addressing the industry's information
